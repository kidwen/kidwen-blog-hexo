http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line static HTTP server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development and learning.

## Install

```bash
npm i -D http-server
```

## Use

```bash
# default ./public or ./
http-server ./views
```
